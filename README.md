 ## Ruby Solo Project

The purpose of this short project was to create an application to manage gym memberships, sessions, and bookings. 
The application should be able to create, read, update, and delete from the database. I particularly enjoyed the backend/ database functionality.

Specific code that I am proud of:

 - [Member model: models/member.rb](models/member.rb)
 
Given more time I would:

 -  Add some site settings which can be accessed by admins of the site via password.
 -  Tidy up the site structure/CSS for a smoother user experience.
 -  Add more complex functionality, like the ability to search for users, or contact them via email by clicking on the     appropriate button within their profile.
