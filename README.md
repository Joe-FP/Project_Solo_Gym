 ## Ruby Solo Project

This purpose of this short project was to create an application to manage gym memberships, sessions, and bookings. 
The application should be able to create, read, update, and delete from the database.

Specific code:

 - [src/main/java/db/DBHelper.java](src/main/java/db/DBHelper.java)
 - [src/main/java/controllers/ArticleController.java](src/main/java/controllers/ArticleController.java)
 
Given more time I would:

 -  Add some site settings which can be accessed by admins of the site.
 -  Tidy up the site structure/CSS for a smoother user experience.
